Welcome to Workshops.md, your one-stop shop for everything workshops! Workshops are mentor-driven group sessions focused around a specific concept. In some, you'll encourage students to code along as you build a new app highlighting a framework/language. In others, you'll spend more time teaching a particular topic and providing context around it with example code. The best workshops combine the best of both: you'll discuss why the specific concept is valuable to learn and then demonstrate its application by building a new app/feature or refactoring an existing one.

As a workshop host, you'll gain incredible experience in captivating an audience, speaking professionally, improving on what you already know, and most importantly, teaching real people challenging concepts from the comfort of your home (maybe?). 96% of workshops have received 4 or 5 star reviews from student attendees.

#Picking a Topic

First step - pick a topic! You have a few options:

Write an agenda based off a course in a learning path. For many students, workshops are course brought to life. If JavaScript is your passion, find a topic that piques your interest in the React, Angular, or Node learning paths.
Write an agenda based off any other course in the library. You can find courses on topics outside of advanced JS (e.g. Frontend, Data Science) by using Search.
Ask your students for inspiration! Are there any specific concepts your 1-on-1 students always struggle with? Is there a particular project in the course that your students get stuck on? Is there an simple app you've always wanted to build live? Is there a specific topic that you're passionate about that you think is valuable to learn? Well here's your opportunity to do something about it in a workshop! If you'd want feedback on your idea(s), just post in #workshops or ping Bhaumik directly.
Fork a previously held workshop topic. In this Google Doc, you'll find a list of every unique workshop that's ever been held. If one of these topics piques your interest, read through the agenda page and click "Fork this workshop". After that, all you have to do is pick a date and hit "Publish". Double-check that the workshop isn't already on the calendar to avoid too much overrlap. You can skip straight to the "preparing for your workshop section" if you choose this option.
A note on time + scope: By default, workshops are one hour long. Realistically, this means a maximum of 40 minutes for actual coding. Plan your agenda accordingly.

#Creating a workshop

If you couldn't find a topic from our past workshops to Fork, you'll need to write a new agenda. Navigate to your dashboard and click on "Add a workshop". Remember to hit "Save" if you can't knock out the agenda in one sitting (should only take ~30 minutes). The draft will then show up on your dashboard so you can go back and edit any part of the agenda. If you need any help putting this together, just post in #workshops. There will be multiple folks at HQ that edit the agenda copy after it's live anyway so feel free to get something on the calendar as soon you're comfortable with it.

Topic: Should be self-explantory. Choose "Community" if your topic doesn’t fall into one of these categories.

Title: The best titles clearly demonstrate what you're going to accomplish in the workshop and/or have a creative spin to them. Examples include: "Bringing SVG Graphics to Life with React", "The Promised Land in Angular" "Rest in peace with $http", "Give your CSS superpowers with Sass and Compass", "Publish a Website with Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages".

Description: A few sentences about what you’ll cover in the workshop. This is your hook! Start with why the particular tool/framework/skill is important or interesting to learn about. Next, describe what you’ll be learning/building in 1-2 sentences. Again, creativity is always endearing. A few examples:

"Gulp is a powerful build tool that lets you automate common tasks like compiling preprocessed CSS, minifying JavaScript and reloading the browser. We'll learn about different build tools and how to create custom gulp tasks using outside libraries."

"Tired of using "for" and "while" loops in your code? There's a better way! We'll talk about using higher-order functions (commonly referred to as "functional programming") to transform, manipulate, and synthesize large arrays of JSON data."

"Ever wonder how to make a nice visualization? Getting your story across is much easier with the right graphics. Using baseball data as our guide, we'll learn how to create concise, interactive charts with multiple tools such as matplotlib and d3.js."

Details: Filling out the details section is half the battle when it comes to preparing for your workshop (especially if your session is not tied to a course!). A few thoughtful minutes here will help you plan your session, and is crucial to setting the right expectations for your students. There are three sections:

“What we’ll cover:” This is a bulleted outline of concepts and techniques that you will cover in the workshop. Think about the 3-5 most important concepts you’ll cover and include them here!

“Perfect for:” Many students ask themselves “Is this workshop right for me?” Well, let them know! Will this workshop be for beginning students or more advanced engineers? Will it be primarily a “code along” session, or more of a demo? Let us know! A neat idea here is to highlight painpoints in a developer's workflow that would be addressed by your workshop.

“How to prepare” While any Thinkful student is welcome to come and watch, workshops work best when everyone is on the same page at the beginning. Is there an article or blog you recommend students to read ahead of time? Do students need to have X installed in order to code along? Is there an example repo for them to clone? Is your workshop tied to a library course? If you answered "yes" to any of the above, make sure to includes the appropriate links in this section!

Topic Tags: Add a few concepts that you’ll be covering in the workshop. These tags will make it easier for students who search for particular topics.

Recurring session: Remember to mark "Yes" if you plan on coming back to the topic! You'll have an option to mark it as weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc. You can also cancel a future workshop later.

Time: If you're available then, the most popular times for workshops have been 7pm - 12am ET during the weekdays and 12 - 6pm ET on the weekends. With that said, a great topic will always generate enough interest. If possible, double-check the calendar to avoid too much overlap with other mentors.

Publish: Woohoo! Once you hit "Publish", double-check the time/day on the workshop calendar and share it in the student (#general) and internal (#workshops) community to generate interest and feedback.

#Preparing for a workshop

Great. Your workshop is published. Next up: prepare for it

 Attend a workshop. Every workshop is special in it's own way but there's plenty of learn from our peers.
 If relevant, complete the course. Attempt the solution on your own and push it to GitHub. (You can share this with your attendees towards the end of your workshop.)
 Plan for 10-15 minutes of introduction, overview and "Why", 40 minutes of actual coding and 10-15 minutes of Q&A dispersed through the session. (More on that next). You can also prepare a few slides for the introductory part.
 Gather any starter code, installation links, helpful resources, follow up content that would want to share with attendees in the chat.
 Create a public GitHub repository of your starter code. You'll share this at the start of the workshop. You can create your respository on the Thinkful-Ed org (github.com/thinkful-ed) or your personal account. Plan points throughout the workshop when you’ll push to GitHub. This will benefit students in two ways: 1) they’ll be able to pull the code you’re demonstrating and follow along, 2) you’ll be demonstrating best practice for using git.
 Familiarize yourself with Owl, Thinkful's video chat app. If you're a new mentor, make sure you've installed the plug-in to allow screensharing. Post in #workshops or #general if you need someone to check something.
 Prepare your environment. Make sure you're in a quiet spot with optimimum wifi access. We strongly recommend using a 2nd monitor, but if you don't have access to one make sure to monitor chat at all times. Also, wear headphones to avoid feedback.
 Promote your workshop! An hour before the workshop starts, post your agenda in #general of the Student Slack.
 Add the workshop to your personal calendar and remember to come 5 minutes early. This is also a great time post the workshop page link again in Slack for students who happen to be online. You’ll get a reminder email three hours before the workshop with a link to the meeting room and a list of RSVPs. Feel free to learn a bit about your attendees by clicking the links next to their names.
#During a workshop

Although we've seen a few different models of successful workshops, a few things have stood out that should be consistent for each one:

Welcome - when new attendees join the room, try to engage with each of them individually. Some questions you can ask: How long they've been a Thinkful student? What course are you enrolled in? How familiar are you with X concept? What were you looking to get out of this workshop? This is important for two reasons 1) Break the ice for that student, encouraging him/her to open up and ask questions later 2) Help you understand where you might want to focus on.

Overview & "Why" - briefly introduce yourself again and describe what you'll be working on for the next hour. You should link the agenda in the chat here if students want to download any starter code or look over the course during the workshop. It's important to explain why the specific concept you're covering is valuable (or interesting) to learn. Not only in the beginning but before each milestone/concept you cover in the workshop. Many mentors decide to prepare a few presentation slides for this section to provide a few visuals but you're welcome to simply have discusions - just make sure you know what you're going to say here.

Questions - workshops aren't lectures. Before you dive in, you should also promote an open atmosphere by encouraging students to ask questions (over chat or audio* depending on the size) whenever they want. It can be helpful to be candid in the introductory part here, "Hey guys, I really don't want to talk to myself for an hour here so remember to ask questions. No question is dumb and I'm sure other students would have the same one!". Include two or three short breaks for Q&A during the workshop if students aren't already asking them. *Encourage participants to keep their microphone muted unless speaking to the group - Owl will let you know where any background noise is coming from.

Recap - towards the end of the workshop, summarize what they've learned. For students who weren't able to follow along closely, you should post the agenda/course in the chat again and encourage them to come back next time. For students who want to dive in deeper, recommend some follow-up resources (especially if there's a logical next step workshop or course). Finally, help out a fellow host and tell them to join the next workshop on the calendar :)

Remember to....

 Keep the chat visible at all times
 Make sure your screenshare is helpful (adjust window sizes, increase font size, zoom in occasionally)
 Pause for questions
 Slow down!
#After the workshop

Congrats! You did it! You were able to engage a group of students on a technical topic, online, for an hour. That's awesome. Just wait till the feedback rolls in...

Feedback (from student) - every attendee will receive an email from Zac asking them to rate the workshop on a 1-5 scale. Once they click on a star, they'll be prompted to add an optional note as well. A day after your workshop, Bhaumik or Zac will share this feedback with you. Ping them on Slack if you don't hear from them :) As of 11/17/15, 96% of the respondees have left a 4 or 5 star rating, for an average of 4.62. That is incredible, let's keep that going!

Feedback (from you) - please share a brief note on how your session went in #workshops. This can include something specific you learned that might be valuable for other hosts, a feature request, a bug report, or just some general thoughts and feelings. Yes, we've gotten great initial feedback from students but it's more important that you have a great experience. Help us help you by sharing your thoughts.

Iterate - if this was the first time hosting a workshop, we recommend hosting it 1-2 more times to nail the topic down. If you had plenty of time left, remember to slow down next time, think of another feature you can add to your app, or another concept you can elaborate on. If you ran out of time, do the opposite - cut a feature or concept. After you've hosted a 2-3 workshops, you're welcome to start hosting more than one a week!

Switch - if you've hosted a workshop more than 3 consecutive weeks or have noticed poor attendance in general, we strongly recommend switching to a new topic. Interest in the topic becomes saturated at that point but demand bounces back after a week or two. Ping Bhaumik on Slack or post in the #workshops channel if you need help picking a new topic.

#Preemptive FAQs

What if I have a small group (1-3 attendees)? That's fine! More room for personalization & questions. I'd encourage your attendees to just ask questions over audio. (Currently, more advanced topics tend to have fewer attendees but that'll start changing as the Workshops product grows). It turns out size of the workshop doesn't impact quality score - we've had multiple "5 star" reviews for workshops with 1 student and workshops with 15 (the record).

What if I have a large group (8+ attendees)? Awesome. You might not have as much time to engage with every attendee as you would in a smaller workshop but expect more questions! Obviously, you wouldn't want students interrupting each other/you so encouraging them to ask questions over chat might be the better option here. Remind them to mute their audio when they're not participating to avoid feedback.

What if I run out of content to cover a bit early? Open up that extra time for Q&A on anything related to workshop topic (or broader). You can also ask anyone who was coding along and got stuck to share their screen so you can help debug and/or explain the concept again. If there isn't much to talk about, provide a quick recap (see above) and call it day!

What if I run out of time? You'll probably realize this 10-15 minutes before it's set to end. At that point you can tell students that you're gonna speed things up or only focus on one particular milestone for the rest of the workshop. Remember, you're always welcome to extend the workshop a bit longer to wrap things up if the attendees are up for it.

What if I get a bunch of audio feedback from an attendee? Encourage that student to mute their audio feed. If you can't get his/her attention, click on "Workshop Mode" mode button. Workshop mode automatically mutes every attendee and hide their video feeds. The student will see exactly what you do - your video feed, screenshare, and a lineup of gravatars on the bottom left. In Workshop Mode, you'll most likely get questions over chat but any attendee can "participate" by turning their video/audio back on temporarily. Because this feature tends to reduce engagement, we recommend only using workshop mode if you're getting significant audio feedback or there's a video lag from a high number of attendees. Stay tuned for a significant UI/UX revamp here!
