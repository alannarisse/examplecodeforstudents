	<ol>
		<li>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</li>
	<li>What do you enjoy about working on a team?</li>
	<li>We use Git for collaboration on our teams here. What can you tell me about your experience with Git? What projects have you used Git with, and how did it help you?</li>
	<li>What would you do to check if a web page is accessible?</li>
	<li>When using Git, what is a merge conflict and how do you handle it?</li>
	<li>Let's look at your app. Walk me through the API you used and how you're getting data from it.</li>
	<li>You've just been given a design and wireframe for a new web page. </li>
	<li>Share your screen and show me how you would go about setting this project up with Git and GitHub.
		<ul>
			<li><pre>git init</pre></li>
			<li>Create a repo in github</li>
			<li>Commit changes locally</li>
			<li><pre>git remote add origin *url*</pre></li>
			<li><pre>git push -u origin master</pre></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This app doesn't follow a11y best practices, and the JS file is incomplete. Complete the getDataFromApi, displaySearchData, and watchSubmit functions. When you're done, this app should allow a user to search for an artist and song title (both should be required), and display the song lyrics. You should make requests to this song lyrics API. Also make any necessary adjustments to make this app accessible. <a href="https://repl.it/@thinkful/song-lyric-API-eval-question">Song Lyric API</a>
