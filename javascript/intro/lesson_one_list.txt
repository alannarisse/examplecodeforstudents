At this point you should feel comfortable:

Explaining what it means when we say that individual browsers implement the JavaScript specification

Linking to external JavaScript files in your HTML

Creating variables with let

Creating constants with const

Recognizing JavaScript's 6 data types when you see them in code you're reading. At this point, you don't need to understand each data type in depth, but you should at least know all 6 (or is it 7? :) ) names.

Using the JavaScript console to execute, debug, and inspect code

If you're struggling with any of these, be sure to reach out to your mentor.
