//In a text editor, create a static web page that says "Hello Interview!" in red, sans-serif font and includes a title element. Open the page in the browser. (Lesson 1.1)
//This project was started by 1 of your designers, and they are having some trouble getting the layout correct.
//First, they used all div tags, so there's no way of knowing what the content is. Re-structure the HTML with semantic tags.
//Second, this page is not accessible. Re-structure the HTML to make it work correctly for screen readers.
//Next, there's an awful looking white bar at the top. The goal is to get the header to have a full-width image, with a centered title.
//Finally, you will see 3 green textBoxes. They should line up in a single row. (Lesson 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)
