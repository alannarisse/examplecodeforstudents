here's our array

myArray= [buttons, string, zippers]
 there are a total of 3 items in my array
 BUT the first item starts at index=0

buttons         string        zippers
 index=0        index=1       index=2



 I'm on buttons, it has an index = 0 but it's my first item

Question #1 = quest[0]
Question#2 = guest[1]

var question  stores the "real" id that starts at 1
array quest sotes index values that start at 0



const question = questionSet[questionNum - 1];

questionNum is a variable of "real" ids that start with 1
questionSet is the array and it starts at 0
