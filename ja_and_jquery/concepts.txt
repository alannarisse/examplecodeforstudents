Concepts

The Dom: Document Object Model
The Dom represents the current state of the page.. not html. When a page loads, the html is loaded into the dom and is then manipulated furter.

Traversing: The dom is a hierarchical structure, we access elements of the DOM by traversing them.

Manipulation: finding an alement in the DOM and changing it's value or behavior.

Script loading order: always load jquery first if you are using it's libraries in your own js file.


Examples fo EVENT LISTENERS
- Listening for when a user submits a form, then validating the data they submitted and displaying helpful error messages if they need to modify their entries
- Listening for when a user types a search term into an input and displaying type-ahead text
- Listening for when a user clicks an element on the page and launching an animation

event.stopPropagation() makes sure if we click on a child element, that our javascript won't traverse back up the dom to it's parents.
